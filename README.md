# Laravel Aquastrap

> If you feel excited to write JavaScript and enjoy the delightful developer experience that Laravel Blade provides then **Aquastrap** is for you

### Aquastrap makes it simple to make network request to the routes, functions of classes ( controller / blade component ) with least amount of extra dependencies introducing
in your project. You can still handle network requests in pure javascript as you would do normally with Fetch / Axios, you do everything in JS but repetitive works are well managed by Aquastrap like request progress, status code, validation messages, upload and download progress etc.
